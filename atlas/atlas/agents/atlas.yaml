  ATLAS is a minimal test agent for learning SuperOptiX.
  Starting with a blank slate, we'll incrementally add:
  - Memory systems
  - Knowledge bases
  - Tools and functions
  - VAPI integration

# Model Configuration
model:
  provider: openai
  name: gpt-4
  temperature: 0.7
  max_tokens: 2000

# System Prompt - Simple and minimal for now
system_prompt: |
  You are ATLAS, a test assistant.

  Your purpose is to help test and validate AI agent capabilities.
  Be helpful, concise, and clear in your responses.
